# Tau long exercise for the 2020 CMSDAS

After having performed the [short exercises](https://github.com/CMSDAS/tau-short-exercise), you have learned how hadronic &tau;
lepton decays are reconstructed and discriminated against jets, electrons and muons at CMS.

The main target of this Tau long exercise is to make you familiar with the general procedure and aspects of an analysis from front to end,
using the measurement of the Z to &tau&tau cross-section as an example.

This exercise is based on the [TauFW](https://github.com/cms-tau-pog/TauFW) analysis framework and builds upon 2018 NanoAOD datasets.
The statistical inference is performed with [CombinedLimit](https://github.com/cms-analysis/HiggsAnalysis-CombinedLimit),
[CombineHarvester](https://github.com/cms-analysis/CombineHarvester), and analysis-specific package [CMSDAS2020TauLong](https://github.com/ArturAkh/CMSDAS2020TauLong).

After this exercise you will learn, how to:
