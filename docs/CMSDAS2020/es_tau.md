# 7. Energy scale of &tau;<sub>h</sub> candidates

As an example of systematic effects, which can also change the shape of an event distribution of a process, we will consider the energy scale
correction for genuine &tau;<sub>h</sub> candidates.

Usually there are two effects on energy, for which corrections are considered in analyses:

* A change in energy scale, best visible on the example of a resonance mass peak shifted to lower or higher values of energy.
* A change in energy resolution, best visibly on the example of a resonance mass peak, which is made broader or narrower.

We will consider the first effect in the context of the exercise.
