# 4. Creating flat n-tuples

After the NanoAOD samples are preselected as described in the [previous section](preselection.md), you can create flat n-tuples based on these samples
with faster turn-around cycles, than using original NanoAOD as input.

This section is meant as an introduction to the way analysis modules in TauFW can be structured that create flat n-tuples, based on the example for the &mu;&tau;<sub>h</sub>,
[ModuleMuTau](../../PicoProducer/python/analysis/CMSDAS2020/ModuleMuTau.py).
