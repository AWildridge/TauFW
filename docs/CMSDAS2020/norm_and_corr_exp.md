# 5. Normalizing and correcting expected contributions

After having produced all flat n-tuples you need, as discussed in section [4](flat_n-tuples.md), you are ready to create your first histograms and plots
of the variables stored in the flat n-tuples.

The topics discussed in this section are crucial for understanding the data you are analysing, and to understand
the impact of improvements and corrections to be applied to step by step for a better data/expectation agreement.

Expect to play around most of your time with the tools introduced in this section, as well as with the analysis module
[ModuleMuTau](../../PicoProducer/python/analysis/CMSDAS2020/ModuleMuTau.py), which you will need to adapt step by step and start reproducing the outputs :).
